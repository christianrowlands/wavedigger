# BSSID Search Web App - Implementation Status

## üö® Recent Fixes (2024-01-30)

### Fixed BSSID Search Issues
- [x] Updated protobuf schema with `optional` fields to match original proto
- [x] Fixed serialization to properly include BSSID data in request
- [x] Changed `numWifiResults` from 0 to -1 (matching wloc CLI)
- [x] Added gzip decompression for compressed responses
- [x] Improved error handling and debug logging
- [x] Fixed protobuf parsing to handle both snake_case and camelCase
- [x] Fixed "parse is not a function" error by using full protobufjs import instead of light build
- [x] Fixed empty protobuf message by using camelCase field names (protobufjs convention)

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Phase 1: Real Apple WLOC API Integration
- [x] Installed protobuf dependencies (`protobufjs`)
- [x] Converted `BSSIDApple.proto` to JavaScript/TypeScript
- [x] Created coordinate encoding/decoding utilities
- [x] Updated API route with protobuf implementation (mock + real API support)
- [x] Added environment variables for API configuration

### Phase 2: UI/UX Enhancements
- [x] Implemented professional theme with CSS variables
  - Custom color system with light theme support
  - Typography scale and spacing system
  - Shadows and transitions
  - Glassmorphism effects
  - Custom animations (fadeIn, slideIn, pulse, spin)
  - Professional gradient backgrounds
- [x] Enhanced all UI components with new theme
  - Updated buttons with hover effects
  - Improved input fields with focus states
  - Styled alerts and tooltips
  - Professional map tooltips

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [x] Multiple BSSID Search
  - Toggle between single and multi-mode
  - Batch search up to 10 BSSIDs
  - Progress indicator for batch searches
  - Paste multiple BSSIDs (comma or newline separated)
  - Individual validation for each BSSID

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Single BSSID Search**: 
   - Enter a real Wi-Fi BSSID from your router or access point
   - Click search to see location on map (if found in Apple's database)

2. **Multiple BSSID Search**:
   - Toggle to "Multi" mode
   - Add multiple real BSSIDs or paste them separated by commas or newlines
   - See all found locations plotted on map

3. **Theme Features**:
   - Professional glassmorphic header
   - Smooth animations on all interactions
   - Hover effects on buttons and cards
   - Focus states on inputs

## üîÑ Pending Features

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement caching strategy (Redis/in-memory)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add light/dark mode toggle
- [ ] Create loading skeletons
- [ ] Add export functionality (JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Share links feature

### Low Priority
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Mobile app
- [ ] Browser extension

## üìù Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Mapbox token (optional - uses Carto if not provided)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=

# Apple API settings
USE_APPLE_API=true  # Always uses real Apple API
ENABLE_CHINA_API=false  # Enable China region endpoint
```

### API Implementation
The app now always uses Apple's real WLOC API:
- Protobuf communication is fully implemented
- Server-side API route handles requests (no CORS issues)
- Automatic coordinate conversion from Apple's int64 format
- Better error messages for network issues or not found BSSIDs
